For the marketing agency,
I updated the codebase so that it follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.
 
To complete this I did the following:
Changed the title from “website” to “Horiseon”
Changed all the div tags with the following:
header
nav
fig
content
article
aside
section
footer
Gave all the images (6) an alt attribute
Created the following new classes for css:
article
benefit-section
Consolidated and cleaned up css with new classes
 
Here is a screenshot of the website:
